# Momentis
For educational purposes, I made a clone of the famous productivity home page "momentum".
The original one is actually a chrome extension that changes the new tab into a clean homepage with some information of the day.

I decided to build just the page, and to clone some functionality.

If you want to test it, you can recreate the same behaviour like momentum using this link as homepage.
